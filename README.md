# Future Engineers – WRO 2025

The Future Engineers category of the WRO 2025 focuses on developing real-world engineering skills through hands-on robotics challenges. This competition encourages creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork while giving participants the opportunity to design, build, and program advanced robotic systems.

Each year, the challenge changes, requiring teams not only to solve the current problem but also to adapt quickly to new scenarios and requirements. This helps participants learn how to think like engineers: iterating on their designs, testing solutions, and improving their approach as they go.

As part of the competition, teams are required to document their entire project process in a GitHub repository. This includes sharing their design decisions, code, and testing results, as well as reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and how their solution evolved over time. The documentation is an important part of the evaluation, as it demonstrates each team’s ability to communicate their engineering process clearly and professionally.
